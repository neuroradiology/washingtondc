 * TODO: this thread can only be safely called from the emu (main) thread and
 * the io_thread because it calls libevent functions, and those functions might
 * not work if libevent is not initialized.  There's no way to know if libevent
 * is initialized from within this function so the only threads that can call
 * this are threads that implicitly know whether or not libevent is initialized.
 * That means the io_thread can call this (although I'm not sure there's any
 * good reason to) and the main/emu thread can call this (because it is the
 * thread which signals the io_thread to clean up and exit).  This is good
 * enough for now because the main/emu thread is the only thread which uses this
 * function anyways.  In the future I will need to revise this behavior if I
